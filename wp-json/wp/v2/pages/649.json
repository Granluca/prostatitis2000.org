(however it may be worth saying, it was repeating oral antibiotics very soon after the infiltrations that really did the trick) On a side note, while fighting prostatitis for a number of years was severely debilitating it was also exceptionally fascinating. It was a terrible experience that created a wonderful spark of fascination in medicine and the desire to help others with suffering and so I have begun my applications to medical school.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for all your help, I hope this e-mail finds you well and happy,<br \/>\nKind regards,<br \/>\nCaspar<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;\">From.
