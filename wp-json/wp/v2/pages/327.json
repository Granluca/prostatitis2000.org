Unable to withstand this high pressure the posterior wall cedes and urine filters into the prostate (fig.5). Barbalias (1997) recently confirmed this hypothesis with his finding of high urethral closure pressure in patients with abacterial prostatitis who benefited from a course of alpha-blockers and antibiotics (Therapy). Kirby (1982) instilled water containing carbon microspheres into the bladders of 10 patients with chronic prostatitis and found the microspheres in 70% of prostate sections taken during transurethral resection (TURP) a few days later. In samples of prostatic secretion from patients with urethral-prostate reflux Persson and Ronquist (1996) found high urate and creatinine levels which not only facilitate stone formation but which also by their very presence induce an inflammatory response in prostate tissue. A transrectal ultrasound scan performed during the dynamic phase of micturition reveals signs of widespread prostatitis when urethral stenosis is present and shows prostatitis is localized in the periurethral area immediately below the bladder neck when bladder neck sclerosis is present (open picture ). Obviously, prostatitis cannot be cured until the anatomic abnormalities which are the underlying cause are rectified.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Urethral prostate Reflux When discussing the peripheral acini we mentioned the urethral-prostate reflux.
